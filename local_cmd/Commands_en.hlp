=== 0^ACCEPT^Set a filter to accept something
Create a filter to accept something

There are 2 types of filter, accept and reject.  See HELP FILTERING for more
info.

=== 0^ACCEPT/ANNOUNCE [0-9] <pattern>^Set an 'accept' filter line for announce
Create an 'accept this announce' line for a filter. 

An accept filter line means that if the announce matches this filter it is
passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERING for more info. Please read this
to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.

You can use any of the following things in this line:-

  info <string>            eg: iota or qsl
  by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2         
  origin <prefixes>
  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW
  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  origin_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,NH
  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>
  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>
  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  by_state <states>
  channel <prefixes>
  wx 1                     filter WX announces
  dest <prefixes>          eg: 6MUK,WDX      (distros)

some examples:-

  acc/ann dest 6MUK
  acc/ann 2 by_zone 14,15,16
  (this could be all on one line: acc/ann dest 6MUK or by_zone 14,15,16)
or
  acc/ann by G,M,2 

for american states

  acc/ann by_state va,nh,ri,nh

You can use the tag 'all' to accept everything eg:

  acc/ann all

but this probably for advanced users...

=== 8^ACCEPT/ANNOUNCE <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern>^Announce filter sysop version
This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as the
default for nodes and users eg:-

  accept/ann by G,M,2
  accept/ann input node_default by G,M,2
  accept/ann user_default by G,M,2

=== 8^ACCEPT/ROUTE <call> [0-9] <pattern>^Set an 'accept' filter line for routing
Create an 'accept this routing PC Protocol' line for a filter. 

An accept filter line means that if a PC16/17/19/21/24/41/50 matches this filter 
it is passed thru that interface. See HELP FILTERING for more info. Please read this
to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.

You can use any of the following things in this line:-

  call <prefixes>        the callsign of the thingy
  call_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  call_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW
  call_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  call_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,NH
  origin <prefixes>      really the interface it came in on
  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW
  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  origin_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,NH

some examples:-

  acc/route gb7djk call_dxcc 61,38 (send only UK+EIRE nodes)
  acc/route gb7djk call gb7djk     (equiv to SET/ISOLATE)

you can now use 'by' as a synonym for 'call' so:

  by = call
  by_dxcc = call_dxcc 

and so on

You can use the tag 'all' to accept everything eg:

  acc/route all


=== 0^ACCEPT/SPOTS [0-9] <pattern>^Set an 'accept' filter line for spots
Create an 'accept this spot' line for a filter. 

An accept filter line means that if the spot matches this filter it is
passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERING for more info. Please read this
to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.

You can use any of the following things in this line:-

  freq <range>           eg: 0/30000 or hf or hf/cw or 6m,4m,2m
  on <range>             same as 'freq'
  call <prefixes>        eg: G,PA,HB9
  info <string>          eg: iota or qsl
  by <prefixes>            
  call_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  call_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW
  call_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  call_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME
  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>
  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>
  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  by_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME
  origin <prefixes>
  channel <prefixes>

'call' means the callsign that has spotted 'by' whoever.

For frequencies, you can use any of the band names defined in
SHOW/BANDS and you can use a subband name like: cw, rtty, data, ssb -
thus: hf/ssb. You can also just have a simple range like: 0/30000 -
this is more efficient than saying simply: freq HF (but don't get
too hung up about that)

some examples:-

  acc/spot 1 on hf/cw
  acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)

You can use the tag 'all' to accept everything, eg:

  acc/spot 3 all

for US states 

  acc/spots by_state VA,NH,RI,MA,ME

but this probably for advanced users...


=== 8^ACCEPT/SPOTS <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern>^Spot filter sysop version
This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as the
default for nodes and users eg:-

  accept/spot db0sue-7 1 by_zone 14,15,16
  accept/spot node_default all
  set/hops node_default 10

  accept/spot user_default by G,M,2

=== 0^ACCEPT/WCY [0-9] <pattern>^set an 'accept' WCY filter
It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you can
filter on the following fields:-

  by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2         
  origin <prefixes>
  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW
  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>
  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>
  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  channel <prefixes>

There are no examples because WCY Broadcasts only come from one place and
you either want them or not (see UNSET/WCY if you don't want them).

This command is really provided for future use.

See HELP FILTER for information.

=== 8^ACCEPT/WCY <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern>^WCY filter sysop version
This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as the
default for nodes and users eg:-

  accept/wcy node_default all
  set/hops node_default 10

=== 0^ACCEPT/WWV [0-9] <pattern>^set an 'accept' WWV filter
It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you can
filter on the following fields:-

  by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2         
  origin <prefixes>
  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW
  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>
  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>
  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  channel <prefixes>

for example 

  accept/wwv by_zone 4

is probably the only useful thing to do (which will only show WWV broadcasts
by stations in the US).

See HELP FILTER for information.

=== 8^ACCEPT/WWV <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern>^WWV filter sysop version
This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as the
default for nodes and users eg:-

  accept/wwv db0sue-7 1 by_zone 4
  accept/wwv node_default all
  set/hops node_default 10

  accept/wwv user_default by W,K

=== 0^ANNOUNCE <text>^Send an announcement to LOCAL users only
<text> is the text of the announcement you wish to broadcast 

=== 0^ANNOUNCE FULL <text>^Send an announcement cluster wide
This will send your announcement cluster wide

=== 5^ANNOUNCE SYSOP <text>^Send an announcement to Sysops only

=== 0^APROPOS <string>^Search help database for <string>
Search the help database for <string> (it isn't case sensitive), and print
the names of all the commands that may be relevant.

=== 0^BLANK [<string>] [<nn>]^Print nn (default 1) blank lines (or strings)
In its basic form this command prints one or more blank lines. However if
you pass it a string it will replicate the string for the width of the 
screen (default 80) and then print that one or more times, so:

  blank 2

prints two blank lines

  blank - 

prints a row of - characters once.

  blank abc

prints 'abcabcabcabcabcabc....'

This is really only of any use in a script file and you can print a maximum
of 9 lines.

=== 0^BYE^Exit from the cluster
This will disconnect you from the cluster

=== 5^CATCHUP <node call> All|[<msgno> ...]^Mark a message as sent
=== 5^UNCATCHUP <node call> All|[msgno> ...]^Unmark a message as sent
When you send messages the fact that you have forwarded it to another node 
is remembered so that it isn't sent again. When you have a new partner
node and you add their callsign to your /spider/msg/forward.pl file, all
outstanding non-private messages will be forwarded to them. This may well
be ALL the non-private messages. You can prevent this by using these 
commmands:-

  catchup GB7DJK all
  catchup GB7DJK 300 301 302 303 500-510
	
and to undo what you have just done:-
  
  uncatchup GB7DJK all
  uncatchup GB7DJK 300 301 302 303 500-510

which will arrange for them to be forward candidates again.

Order is not important.

=== 0^CHAT <group> <text>^Chat or Conference to a group
It is now possible to JOIN a group and have network wide conferencing to that
group. DXSpider does not (and probably will not) implement the AK1A 
conference mode as this seems very limiting, is hardly used and doesn't seem
to work too well anyway.

This system uses the existing ANN system and is compatible with both other
DXSpider nodes and AK1A clusters (they use ANN/<group>). 

You can be a member of as many "groups" as you want. To join a group type:-

  JOIN FOC    (where FOC is the group name)

To leave a group type:-

  LEAVE FOC

You can see which groups you are in by typing:-

  STAT/USER

and you can see whether your mate is in the group, if he connects to the
same node as you, by typing:-

  STAT/USER g1tlh

To send a message to a group type:-

  CHAT FOC hello everyone

or

  CH #9000 hello I am back

See also JOIN, LEAVE, SHOW/CHAT

=== 0^CLEAR/ANNOUNCE [1|all]^Clear a announce filter line
This command allows you to clear (remove) a line in a annouce filter or to 
remove the whole filter.

see CLEAR/SPOTS for a more detailed explanation.

=== 8^CLEAR/ANNOUNCE <callsign> [input] [0-9|all]^Clear a announce filter line
A sysop can clear an input or normal output filter for a user or the
node_default or user_default. 

=== 6^CLEAR/DUPEFILE^Clear out the dupefile completely
The system maintains a list of duplicate announces and spots (amongst many
other things). Sometimes this file gets corrupted during operation
(although not very often). This command will remove the file and start
again from scratch.

Try this if you get several duplicate DX Spots, one after another.

Please ONLY use this command if you have a problem. And then only once.
If it does not cure your problem, then repeating the command won't help.
Get onto the dxspider-support list and let us try to help.

If you use this command frequently then you will cause other people, as
well as yourself, a lot of problems with duplicates.

=== 0^CLEAR/ROUTE [1|all]^Clear a route filter line
This command allows you to clear (remove) a line in a route filter or to 
remove the whole filter.

see CLEAR/SPOTS for a more detailed explanation.

=== 8^CLEAR/ROUTE <callsign> [input] [0-9|all]^Clear a route filter line
A sysop can clear an input or normal output filter for a user or the
node_default or user_default. 

=== 0^CLEAR/SPOTS [0-9|all]^Clear a spot filter line
This command allows you to clear (remove) a line in a spot filter or to 
remove the whole filter.

If you have a filter:-

  acc/spot 1 on hf/cw
  acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)

and you say:-

  clear/spot 1

you will be left with:-

  acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)

If you do:

  clear/spot all

the filter will be completely removed.

=== 8^CLEAR/SPOTS <callsign> [input] [0-9|all]^Clear a spot filter line
A sysop can clear an input or normal output filter for a user or the
node_default or user_default. 

=== 0^CLEAR/WCY [1|all]^Clear a WCY filter line
This command allows you to clear (remove) a line in a WCY filter or to 
remove the whole filter.

see CLEAR/SPOTS for a more detailed explanation.

=== 8^CLEAR/WCY <callsign> [input] [0-9|all]^Clear a WCY filter line
A sysop can clear an input or normal output filter for a user or the
node_default or user_default. 

=== 0^CLEAR/WWV [1|all]^Clear a WWV filter line
This command allows you to clear (remove) a line in a WWV filter or to 
remove the whole filter.

see CLEAR/SPOTS for a more detailed explanation.

=== 8^CLEAR/WWV <callsign> [input] [0-9|all]^Clear a WWV filter line
A sysop can clear an input or normal output filter for a user or the
node_default or user_default. 

=== 5^CONNECT <callsign>^Start a connection to another DX Cluster
Start a connection process that will culminate in a new connection to the
DX cluster <callsign>. This process creates a new 'client' process which will
use the script in /spider/connect/<callsign> to effect the 'chat' exchange
necessary to traverse the network(s) to logon to the cluster <callsign>.

=== 5^CREATE/USER <callsign> ...^Create this user from the User Database
This command will create one or more new users. None of the fields
like name, qth etc will be filled in. It is just a new entry in the user
database to which one can add more stuff like SET/PASSWORD or by SPOOF.

=== 9^DELETE/USDB <callsign> ...^Delete this user from the US State Database
This command will completely remove a one or more callsigns
from the US States database.

There is NO SECOND CHANCE.

It goes without saying that you should use this command CAREFULLY!

Note that these callsign may be re-instated by any weekly updates from 
the FCC.

=== 9^DELETE/USER <callsign> ...^Delete this user from the User Database
This command will completely remove a one or more users from the database.

There is NO SECOND CHANCE.

It goes without saying that you should use this command CAREFULLY!

=== 0^DBAVAIL^Show a list of all the Databases in the system
Title says it all really, this command lists all the databases defined
in the system. It is also aliased to SHOW/COMMAND.

=== 9^DBCREATE <name>^Create a database entry
=== 9^DBCREATE <name> chain <name> [<name>..]^Create a chained database entry
=== 9^DBCREATE <name> remote <node>^Create a remote database entry
=== 9^DBCREATE <name> cmd <dxspider command>^make a local command available as a DB
DBCREATE allows you to define a database in the system. It doesn't actually
create anything, just defines it.

The databases that are created are simple DB_File hash databases, they are 
therefore already 'indexed'.

You can define a local database with the first form of the command eg:

  DBCREATE oblast

You can also chain databases with the addition of the 'chain' keyword. 
This will search each database one after the other. A typical example 
is:

  DBCREATE sdx_qsl chain sql_ad

No checking is done to see if the any of the chained databases exist, in
fact it is usually better to do the above staement first then do each of
the chained databases.

Databases can exist offsite. To define a database that lives on another 
node do:

  DBCREATE buckmaster remote gb7dxc

Remote databases cannot be chained; however, the last database in a 
a chain can be a remote database eg:

  DBCREATE qsl chain gb7dxc

To see what databases have been defined do:

  DBAVAIL (or it will have been aliased to SHOW/COMMAND)

It would be normal for you to add an entry into your local Aliases file
to allow people to use the 'SHOW/<dbname>' style syntax. So you would
need to add a line like:-

  's' => [
    ..
    ..
    '^sh\w*/buc', 'dbshow buckmaster', 'dbshow',
    ..
    ..
   ],

to allow 
 
  SH/BUCK g1tlh

to work as they may be used to.

You can also make local commands available as 'pseudo' databases. You
can therefore make spider special commands available as a database. I
imagine that this will be primarily useful for remote access from 
legacy nodes. For example:-

  DBCREATE dxqsl cmd show/dxqsl

You also use one of these databases in a chain. This may be useful 
locally. 

See DBIMPORT for the importing of existing AK1A format data to databases.
See DXEXPORT for how to export an AK1A data in a form able to be imported.
See DBSHOW for generic database enquiry


=== 9^DBEXPORT <dbname> <filename>^Export an AK1A data to a file
Sometimes one needs to export the data from an existing database file,
maybe for a backup or to send to another node.

  DBEXPORT oblast /tmp/OBLAST.FUL

will export the OBLAST database to /tmp/OBLAST.FUL

There is no protection, it is up to you not to overwrite a file that
is important to you.

See DBIMPORT for the importing of existing AK1A format data to databases.

=== 9^DBIMPORT <dbname> <filename>^Import AK1A data into a database
If you want to import or update data in bulk to a database you can use
this command. It will either create or update entries into an existing
database. For example:-

  DBIMPORT oblast /tmp/OBLAST.FUL

will import the standard OBLAST database that comes with AK1A into the
oblast database held locally.

See DBEXPORT for how to export an AK1A database

=== 9^DBREMOVE <dbname>^Delete a database
DBREMOVE will completely remove a database entry and also delete any data
file that is associated with it. 

There is no warning, no comeback, no safety net. 

For example:

  DBREMOVE oblast 

will remove the oblast database from the system and it will also remove
the associated datafile.

I repeat:

There is no warning, no comeback, no safety net.
 
You have been warned.

=== 0^DBSHOW <dbname> <key>^Display an entry, if it exists, in a database
This is the generic user interface to the database to the database system.
It is expected that the sysop will add an entry to the local Aliases file
so that users can use the more familiar AK1A style of enquiry such as:

  SH/BUCK G1TLH

but if he hasn't and the database really does exist (use DBAVAIL or
SHOW/COMMAND to find out) you can do the same thing with:

  DBSHOW buck G1TLH

=== 9^DEBUG^Set the cluster program into debug mode
Executing this command will only have an effect if you are running the cluster
in debug mode i.e.

	perl -d cluster.pl

It will interrupt the cluster just after the debug command has finished.

=== 0^DIRECTORY^List messages 
=== 0^DIRECTORY ALL^List all messages
=== 0^DIRECTORY OWN^List your own messages
=== 0^DIRECTORY NEW^List all new messages
=== 0^DIRECTORY TO <call>^List all messages to <call>
=== 0^DIRECTORY FROM <call>^List all messages from <call>
=== 0^DIRECTORY SUBJECT <string>^List all messages with <string> in subject
=== 0^DIRECTORY <nn>^List last <nn> messages
=== 0^DIRECTORY <from>-<to>^List messages <from> message <to> message 
List the messages in the messages directory.

If there is a 'p' one space after the message number then it is a 
personal message. If there is a '-' between the message number and the
'p' then this indicates that the message has been read.

You can use shell escape characters such as '*' and '?' in the <call>
fields.

You can combine some of the various directory commands together eg:-

   DIR TO G1TLH 5
or 
   DIR SUBJECT IOTA 200-250

You can abbreviate all the commands to one letter and use ak1a syntax:-

   DIR/T G1* 10
   DIR/S QSL 10-100 5

=== 5^DIRECTORY-^
Sysops can see all users' messages.

=== 8^DISCONNECT <call> [<call> ...]^Disconnect user(s) or node(s)
Disconnect any <call> connected locally.

In addition you can disconnect all users (except yourself) with

  DISC users

or all nodes with:

  DISC nodes

or everything (except yourself) with

  DISC all

=== 0^DX [BY <call>] <freq> <call> <remarks>^Send a DX spot
This is how you send a DX Spot to other users. You can, in fact, now
enter the <freq> and the <call> either way round. 

   DX FR0G 144.600
   DX 144.600 FR0G
   DX 144600 FR0G 

will all give the same result. You can add some remarks to the end
of the command and they will be added to the spot.

   DX FR0G 144600 this is a test

You can credit someone else by saying:-

   DX by G1TLH FR0G 144.600 he isn't on the cluster

The <freq> is compared against the available bands set up in the 
cluster.  See SHOW/BANDS for more information.

=== 9^DXQSL_EXPORT <filename>^Export SH/DXSQL information to a file
The SHOW/DXQSL command shows any QSL managers that have been extracted
from comments on a DX spot.

Use this command to export the current state of the information to
a CSV style text file. For example:

   DXQSL_EXPORT /tmp/qsl.csv

NOTE: this command will overwrite any file that you have write
permission for.

See also DXQSL_IMPORT to import one of these files.

=== 9^DXQSL_IMPORT <filename>^Import SH/DXSQL information from a file
The SHOW/DXQSL command shows any QSL managers that have been extracted
from comments on a DX spot.

Use this command to restore a file created by the DXSQL_EXPORT command.
For example:

   DXQSL_IMPORT /tmp/qsl.csv

The data in this file will UPDATE any information that may already be
present. This may not be what you want. To make the data the same as
the import file then you must:

* stop the node
* remove /spider/data/qsl.v1
* restart the node
* login as sysop
* do the import

Preferably before too many DX spots with qsl manager info come in.

=== 0^ECHO <line>^Echo the line to the output
This command is useful in scripts and so forth for printing the
line that you give to the command to the output. You can use this
in user_default scripts and the SAVE command for titling and so forth

The script will interpret certain standard "escape" sequences as follows:-

  \t - becomes a TAB character (0x09 in ascii)
  \a - becomes a BEEP character (0x07 in ascii)
  \n - prints a new line

So the following example:-

  echo GB7DJK is a dxcluster

produces:-

  GB7DJK is a dxcluster

on the output. You don't need a \n on the end of the line you want to send.

A more complex example:-

  echo GB7DJK\n\tg1tlh\tDirk\n\tg3xvf\tRichard

produces:-

  GB7DJK
          g1tlh   Dirk
          g3xvf   Richard

on the output.
                                      
=== 9^EXPORT <msgno> <filename>^Export a message to a file
Export a message to a file. This command can only be executed on a local
console with a fully privileged user. The file produced will be in a form
ready to be imported back into the cluster by placing it in the import 
directory (/spider/msg/import).

This command cannot overwrite an existing file. This is to provide some 
measure of security. Any files written will owned by the same user as the 
main cluster, otherwise you can put the new files anywhere the cluster can
access. For example:-

  EXPORT 2345 /tmp/a

=== 9^EXPORT_USERS [<filename>]^Export the users database to ascii
Export the users database to a file in ascii format. If no filename
is given then it will export the file to /spider/data/user_asc.

If the file already exists it will be renamed to <filename>.o. In fact
up to 5 generations of the file can be kept each one with an extra 'o' on the
suffix. 

BE WARNED: this will write to any file you have write access to. No check is
made on the filename (if any) that you specify.

=== 0^FILTERING...^Filtering things in DXSpider
There are a number of things you can filter in the DXSpider system. They
all use the same general mechanism.

In general terms you can create a 'reject' or an 'accept' filter which
can have up to 10 lines in it. You do this using, for example:-
 
  accept/spots .....
  reject/spots .....

where ..... are the specific commands for that type of filter. There
are filters for spots, wwv, announce, wcy and (for sysops)
connects. See each different accept or reject command reference for
more details.

There is also a command to clear out one or more lines in a filter and
one to show you what you have set. They are:-

  clear/spots 1
  clear/spots all

and 
  
  show/filter

There is clear/xxxx command for each type of filter.

For now we are going to use spots for the examples, but you can apply
the principles to all types of filter.

There are two main types of filter 'accept' or 'reject'; which you use
depends entirely on how you look at the world and what is least
writing to achieve what you want. Each filter has 10 lines (of any
length) which are tried in order. If a line matches then the action
you have specified is taken (ie reject means ignore it and accept
means gimme it).

The important thing to remember is that if you specify a 'reject'
filter (all the lines in it say 'reject/spots' (for instance)) then if
a spot comes in that doesn't match any of the lines then you will get
it BUT if you specify an 'accept' filter then any spots that don't
match are dumped. For example if I have a one line accept filter:-

  accept/spots on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)

then automatically you will ONLY get VHF spots from or to CQ zones 14
15 and 16.  If you set a reject filter like:

  reject/spots on hf/cw

Then you will get everything EXCEPT HF CW spots, If you am interested in IOTA
and will work it even on CW then you could say:-

  reject/spots on hf/cw and not info iota

But in that case you might only be interested in iota and say:-

  accept/spots not on hf/cw or info iota

which is exactly the same. You should choose one or the other until
you are confortable with the way it works. Yes, you can mix them
(actually you can have an accept AND a reject on the same line) but
don't try this at home until you can analyse the results that you get
without ringing up the sysop for help.

Another useful addition now is filtering by US state

  accept/spots by_state VA,NH,RI,ME

You can arrange your filter lines into logical units, either for your
own understanding or simply convenience. I have one set frequently:-

  reject/spots 1 on hf/cw
  reject/spots 2 on 50000/1400000 not (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)  

What this does is to ignore all HF CW spots (being a class B I can't
read any CW and couldn't possibly be interested in HF :-) and also
rejects any spots on VHF which don't either originate or spot someone
in Europe.

This is an exmaple where you would use the line number (1 and 2 in
this case), if you leave the digit out, the system assumes '1'. Digits
'0'-'9' are available.

You can leave the word 'and' out if you want, it is implied. You can
use any number of brackets to make the 'expression' as you want
it. There are things called precedence rules working here which mean
that you will NEED brackets in a situation like line 2 because,
without it, will assume:-

  (on 50000/1400000 and by_zone 14,15,16) or call_zone 14,15,16 

annoying, but that is the way it is. If you use OR - use
brackets. Whilst we are here CASE is not important. 'And BY_Zone' is
just 'and by_zone'.

If you want to alter your filter you can just redefine one or more
lines of it or clear out one line. For example:-

  reject/spots 1 on hf/ssb

or 

  clear/spots 1

To remove the filter in its entirty:-

  clear/spots all

There are similar CLEAR commands for the other filters:-

  clear/announce
  clear/wcy
  clear/wwv

ADVANCED USERS:-

Once you are happy with the results you get, you may like to experiment. 

my example that filters hf/cw spots and accepts vhf/uhf spots from EU
can be written with a mixed filter, eg:

  rej/spot on hf/cw
  acc/spot on 0/30000
  acc/spot 2 on 50000/1400000 and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)

each filter slot actually has a 'reject' slot and an 'accept'
slot. The reject slot is executed BEFORE the accept slot.

It was mentioned earlier that after a reject test that doesn't match,
the default for following tests is 'accept', the reverse is true for
'accept'. In the example what happens is that the reject is executed
first, any non hf/cw spot is passed to the accept line, which lets
thru everything else on HF.

The next filter line lets through just VHF/UHF spots from EU.

=== 8^FORWARD/LATLONG <node_call>^Send latitude and longitude information to another cluster
This command sends all the latitude and longitude information that your
cluster is holding against callsigns.  One advantage of recieving this
information is that more locator information is held by you.  This
means that more locators are given on the DX line assuming you have
SET/DXGRID enabled.  This could be a LOT of information though, so
it is not recommended on slow links.

=== 1^FORWARD/OPERNAM <call>^Send out information on this <call> to all clusters
This command sends out any information held in the user file which can 
be broadcast in PC41 protocol packets. This information is Name, QTH, Location
and Homenode. PC41s are only sent for the information that is available.
 
=== 8^GET/KEPS^Obtain the latest AMSAT Keplarian Elements from the web
There are various ways that one can obtain the AMSAT keps. Traditionally the
regular method was to get on the mailing list and then arrange for the email
to be piped into convkeps.pl and arrange from the crontab to run LOAD/KEPS. 
For various reasons, it was quite easy for one to be silently dropped 
from this mailing list. 

With the advent of asynchronous (web) connections in DXSpider it is now 
possible to use this command to get the latest keps direct from the
AMSAT web site. One can do this from the command line or one can add a line 
in the local DXSpider crontab file to do periodically (say once a week).

This command will clear out the existing keps and then run LOAD/KEPS 
for you (but only) after a successful download from the AMSAT website.
 
=== 0^HELP^The HELP Command
HELP is available for a number of commands. The syntax is:-

  HELP <cmd>
  
Where <cmd> is the name of the command you want help on.

All commands can be abbreviated, so SHOW/DX can be abbreviated
to SH/DX, ANNOUNCE can be shortened to AN and so on.

Look at the APROPOS <string> command which will search the help database
for the <string> you specify and give you a list of likely commands
to look at with HELP.

=== 5^INIT <node>^Re-initialise a link to an AK1A compatible node
This command attempts to re-initialise a link to a (usually) AK1A node
that has got confused, usually by a protocol loop of some kind. It may
work - but you usually will be better off simply disconnecting it (or
better, if it is a real AK1A node, doing an RCMD <node> DISC/F <your
node>).

Best of luck - you will need it.
  
=== 9^DEMONSTRATE <call> <command>^Demonstrate a command to another user
This command is provided so that sysops can demonstrate commands to 
other users. It runs a command as though that user had typed it in and
then sends the output to that user, together with the command that 
caused it.

  DEMO g7brn sh/dx iota oc209
  DEMO g1tlh set/here

Note that this command is similar to SPOOF and will have the same side
effects. Commands are run at the privilege of the user which is being
demonstrated to. 

=== 0^JOIN <group>^Join a chat or conference group
JOIN allows you to join a network wide conference group. To join a
group (called FOC in this case) type:-

  JOIN FOC

See also CHAT, LEAVE, SHOW/CHAT

=== 0^KILL <msgno> [<msgno..]^Delete a message from the local system
=== 0^KILL <from msgno>-<to msgno>^Delete a range of messages
=== 0^KILL from <regex>^Delete messages FROM a callsign or pattern
=== 0^KILL to <regex>^Delete messages TO a callsign or pattern
=== 5^KILL FULL <msgno> [<msgno..]^Delete a message from the whole cluster
Delete a message from the local system. You will only be able to
delete messages that you have originated or been sent (unless you are
the sysop). 

  KILL 1234-1255

Will delete all the messages that you own between msgnos 1234 and 1255.

  KILL from g1tlh

will delete all the messages from g1tlh (if you are g1tlh). Similarly:

  KILL to g1tlh

will delete all messages to g1tlh.

  KILL FULL 1234
 
will delete a message (usually a 'bulletin') from the whole cluster system. 

This uses the subject field, so any messages that have exactly the
same subject will be deleted. Beware!

=== 6^KILL EXPunge <msgno> [<msgno..]^Expunge a message
Deleting a message using the normal KILL commands only marks that message
for deletion. The actual deletion only happens later (usually two days later).

The KILL EXPUNGE command causes the message to be truly deleted more or less
immediately.

It otherwise is used in the same way as the KILL command.

=== 0^LEAVE <group>^Leave a chat or conference group
LEAVE allows you to leave a network wide conference group. To leave a
group (called FOC in this case) type:-

  LEAVE FOC

See also CHAT, JOIN, SHOW/CHAT

=== 0^LINKS^Show which nodes is physically connected
This is a quick listing that shows which links are connected and
some information about them. See WHO for a list of all connections.

=== 9^LOAD/ALIASES^Reload the command alias table
Reload the /spider/cmd/Aliases file after you have editted it. You
will need to do this if you change this file whilst the cluster is
running in order for the changes to take effect.

=== 9^LOAD/BANDS^Reload the band limits table
Reload the /spider/data/bands.pl file if you have changed it manually whilst
the cluster is running. 

=== 9^LOAD/BADMSG^Reload the bad msg table
Reload the /spider/msg/badmsg.pl file if you have changed it manually whilst
the cluster is running. This table contains a number of perl regular 
expressions which are searched for in the fields targetted of each message. 
If any of them match then that message is immediately deleted on receipt. 

=== 9^LOAD/BADWORDS^Reload the bad words table
Reload the /spider/data/badwords file if you have changed it manually whilst
the cluster is running. This file contains a list of words which, if found
on certain text portions of PC protocol, will cause those protocol frames
to be rejected. It will all put out a message if any of these words are
used on the announce, dx and talk commands. The words can be one or 
more on a line, lines starting with '#' are ignored.

=== 9^LOAD/CMD_CACHE^Reload the automatic command cache
Normally, if you change a command file in the cmd or local_cmd tree it
will automatially be picked up by the cluster program. Sometimes it
can get confused if you are doing a lot of moving commands about or
delete a command in the local_cmd tree and want to use the normal one
again. Execute this command to reset everything back to the state it
was just after a cluster restart. To see what is in the command cache
see SHOW/CMD_CACHE.

=== 9^LOAD/FORWARD^Reload the msg forwarding routing table
Reload the /spider/msg/forward.pl file if you have changed it
manually whilst the cluster is running.

=== 5^LOAD/KEPS^Load new keps data
=== 5^LOAD/KEPS [nn]^Load new keps data from message
If there is no message number then reload the current Keps data from
the Keps.pm data file. You create this file by running 

 /spider/perl/convkeps.pl <filename>

on a file containing NASA 2 line keps as a message issued by AMSAT. 

If there is a message number, then it will take the message, run
convkeps.pl on it and then load the data, all in one step.

These messages are sent to ALL by GB7DJK (and others) from time to time. 

=== 9^LOAD/MESSAGES^Reload the system messages file
If you change the /spider/perl/Messages file (usually whilst
fiddling/writing new commands) you can have them take effect during a
cluster session by executing this command. You need to do this if get
something like :-

unknown message 'xxxx' in lang 'en'

=== 9^LOAD/PREFIXES^Reload the prefix table
Reload the /spider/data/prefix_data.pl file if you have changed it
manually whilst the cluster is running.

=== 5^MERGE <node> [<no spots>/<no wwv>]^Ask for the latest spots and WWV 
MERGE allows you to bring your spot and wwv database up to date. By default
it will request the last 10 spots and 5 WWVs from the node you select. The 
node must be connected locally.

You can request any number of spots or wwv and although they will be appended
to your databases they will not duplicate any that have recently been added 
(the last 2 days for spots and last month for WWV data).

=== 9^MSG <cmd> <msgno> [data ... ]^Alter various message parameters
Alter message parameters like To, From, Subject, whether private or bulletin
or return receipt (RR) is required or whether to keep this message from timing
out.

  MSG TO <msgno> <call>     - change TO callsign to <call>
  MSG FRom <msgno> <call>   - change FROM callsign to <call>
  MSG PRrivate <msgno>      - set private flag
  MSG NOPRrivate <msgno>    - unset private flag
  MSG RR <msgno>            - set RR flag
  MSG NORR <msgno>          - unset RR flag
  MSG KEep <msgno>          - set the keep flag (message won't be deleted ever)
  MSG NOKEep <msgno>        - unset the keep flag
  MSG SUbject <msgno> <new> - change the subject to <new>
  MSG WAittime <msgno>      - remove any waitting time for this message
  MSG NOREad <msgno>        - mark message as unread
  MSG REad <msgno>          - mark message as read
  MSG QUeue                 - queue any outstanding bulletins
  MSG QUeue 1               - queue any outstanding private messages

You can look at the status of a message by using:-

  STAT/MSG <msgno>      

This will display more information on the message than DIR does.
   
=== 8^PC <call> <text>^Send text (eg PC Protocol) to <call>
Send some arbitrary text to a locally connected callsign. No
processing is done on the text. This command allows you to send PC
Protocol to unstick things if problems arise (messages get stuck
etc). eg:-

   pc gb7djk PC33^GB7TLH^GB7DJK^400^
or 
   pc G1TLH Try doing that properly!!!

=== 0^KILL <msgno> [<msgno> ...]^Remove or erase a message from the system
You can get rid of any message to or originating from your callsign using 
this command. You can remove more than one message at a time.

=== 5^KILL <from>-<to>^Remove a range of messages from the system
=== 5^KILL FROM <call>^Remove all messages from a callsign
=== 5^KILL TO <call>^Remove all messages to a callsign
=== 5^KILL FULL <msgno> [<msgno]^Remove a message from the entire cluster
Remove this message from the entire cluster system as well as your node.

=== 5^KILL^
As a sysop you can kill any message on the system.

=== 8^PC <call> <text>^Send arbitrary text to a connected callsign
Send any text you like to the callsign requested. This is used mainly to send
PC protocol to connected nodes either for testing or to unstick things. 

You can also use in the same way as a talk command to a connected user but
without any processing, added of "from <blah> to <blah" or whatever.
 
=== 1^PING <node call>^Check the link quality between nodes
This command allows you to send a frame to another cluster node on
the network and get a return frame.  The time it takes to do this
is a good indication of the quality of the link.  The actual time
it takes is output to the console in seconds.
Any visible cluster node can be PINGed.

=== 0^QSP [<tocall>] [<refnum1>] [<refnum2>] [...]^qsp a QTC-NET telegram 

This command creates a QSP (delivery notification) to a QTC-NET telegram. 
It is used when you are sure that the telegram has arrived as it's target
callsign. The telegram will then removed from new and timeline_new. 

if you qsp the telegrams you received by yourself, you may omit the tocall. 

=== 1^RCMD <node call> <cmd>^Send a command to another DX Cluster
This command allows you to send nearly any command to another DX Cluster
node that is connected to the system. 

Whether you get any output is dependant on a) whether the other system knows
that the node callsign of this cluster is in fact a node b) whether the
other system is allowing RCMDs from this node and c) whether you have
permission to send this command at all.

=== 0^READ^Read the next unread personal message addressed to you
=== 0^READ <msgno>^Read the specified message
You can read any messages that are sent as 'non-personal' and also any
message either sent by or sent to your callsign.

=== 5^READ-^
As a sysop you may read any message on the system

=== 0^REJECT^Set a filter to reject something
Create a filter to reject something

There are 2 types of filter, accept and reject.  See HELP FILTERING for more
info.

=== 0^REJECT/ANNOUNCE [0-9] <pattern>^Set a 'reject' filter line for announce
Create an 'reject this announce' line for a filter. 

A reject filter line means that if the announce matches this filter it is
passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERING for more info. Please read this
to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.

You can use any of the following things in this line:-

  info <string>            eg: iota or qsl
  by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2         
  origin <prefixes>
  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW
  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  origin_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME
  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>
  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>
  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  by_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME
  channel <prefixes>
  wx 1                     filter WX announces
  dest <prefixes>          eg: 6MUK,WDX      (distros)

some examples:-

  rej/ann by_zone 14,15,16 and not by G,M,2
 
You can use the tag 'all' to reject everything eg:

  rej/ann all

but this probably for advanced users...

=== 8^REJECT/ANNOUNCE <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern>^Announce filter sysop version
This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as the
default for nodes and users eg:-

  reject/ann by G,M,2
  reject/ann input node_default by G,M,2
  reject/ann user_default by G,M,2

=== 0^REJECT/SPOTS [0-9] <pattern>^Set a 'reject' filter line for spots
Create a 'reject this spot' line for a filter. 

A reject filter line means that if the spot matches this filter it is
dumped (not passed on). See HELP FILTERING for more info. Please read this
to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.

You can use any of the following things in this line:-

  freq <range>           eg: 0/30000 or hf or hf/cw or 6m,4m,2m
  on <range>             same as 'freq'
  call <prefixes>        eg: G,PA,HB9
  info <string>          eg: iota or qsl
  by <prefixes>            
  call_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  call_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW
  call_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  call_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME
  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>
  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>
  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  by_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME
  origin <prefixes>
  channel <prefixes>

'call' means the callsign that has spotted 'by' whoever.
 
For frequencies, you can use any of the band names defined in
SHOW/BANDS and you can use a subband name like: cw, rtty, data, ssb -
thus: hf/ssb. You can also just have a simple range like: 0/30000 -
this is more efficient than saying simply: on HF (but don't get
too hung up about that)

some examples:-

  rej/spot 1 on hf
  rej/spot 2 on vhf and not (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)

You can use the tag 'all' to reject everything eg:

  rej/spot 3 all

but this probably for advanced users...

=== 8^REJECT/ROUTE <call> [0-9] <pattern>^Set an 'reject' filter line for routing
Create an 'reject this routing PC Protocol' line for a filter. 

An reject filter line means that if a PC16/17/19/21/24/41/50 matches this filter 
it is NOT passed thru that interface. See HELP FILTERING for more info. Please 
read this to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.

You can use any of the following things in this line:-

  call <prefixes>        the callsign of the thingy
  call_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  call_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW
  call_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  call_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME
  origin <prefixes>      really the interface it came in on
  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW
  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  origin_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME

some examples:-

  rej/route gb7djk call_dxcc 61,38 (everything except  UK+EIRE nodes)

You can use the tag 'all' to reject everything eg:

  rej/route all     (equiv to [very] restricted mode)

as with ACCEPT/ROUTE 'by' is now a synonym for 'call'.

=== 8^REJECT/SPOTS <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern>^Spot filter sysop version
This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as the
default for nodes and users eg:-

  reject/spot db0sue-7 1 by_zone 14,15,16
  reject/spot node_default all
  set/hops node_default 10

  reject/spot user_default by G,M,2

=== 0^REJECT/WCY [0-9] <pattern>^set a 'reject' WCY filter
It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you can
filter on the following fields:-

  by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2         
  origin <prefixes>
  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW
  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>
  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>
  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  channel <prefixes>

There are no examples because WCY Broadcasts only come from one place and
you either want them or not (see UNSET/WCY if you don't want them).

This command is really provided for future use.

See HELP FILTER for information.

=== 8^REJECT/WCY <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern>^WCY filter sysop version
This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as the
default for nodes and users eg:-

  reject/wcy gb7djk all

=== 0^REJECT/WWV [0-9] <pattern>^set a 'reject' WWV filter
It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you can
filter on the following fields:-

  by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2         
  origin <prefixes>
  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW
  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>
  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>
  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>
  channel <prefixes>

for example 

  reject/wwv by_zone 14,15,16

is probably the only useful thing to do (which will only show WWV broadcasts
by stations in the US).

See HELP FILTER for information.

=== 8^REJECT/WWV <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern>^WWV filter sysop version
This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as the
default for nodes and users eg:-

  reject/wwv db0sue-7 1 by_zone 4
  reject/wwv node_default all

  reject/wwv user_default by W

=== 0^REPLY^Reply (privately) to the last message that you have read
=== 0^REPLY <msgno>^Reply (privately) to the specified message
=== 0^REPLY B <msgno>^Reply as a Bulletin to the specified message
=== 0^REPLY NOPrivate <msgno>^Reply as a Bulletin to the specified message
=== 0^REPLY RR <msgno>^Reply to the specified message with read receipt
You can reply to a message and the subject will automatically have
"Re:" inserted in front of it, if it isn't already present.

You can also use all the extra qualifiers such as RR, PRIVATE, 
NOPRIVATE, B that you can use with the SEND command (see SEND
for further details)

=== 9^SAVE [-d -t -a] <filename> "<cmd>" [...]^Save command output to a file
This sysop only cammand allows you to save the output of one or more
commands to a file. For example:-

  save /spider/packclus/dxstats show/dxstat

will save the output of the normal command "show/dxstat" to the file
"dxstats" in the files area.

You can have some extra flags to the save which will either 
date stamp or time stamp or both the filename so:-

  save -d /tmp/a <cmd> creates /tmp/a_6-Jan-2002
  save -t /tmp/a <cmd> creates /tmp/a_2301Z
  save -d -t /tmp/a <cmd> creates /tmp/a_6-Jan-2002_2301Z

The -a flag means append to the file instead of overwriting it.

You can have more than one command on the line, to do this you MUST
enclose each command in double quotes (") eg:-

  save /tmp/a "sh/hfstats" "blank +" "sh/vhfstats"

or

  save /tmp/a "sh/hfstats","blank +","sh/vhfstats"

You can only write into places that the cluster has permission for (which
is that of the "sysop" user [which had BETTER NOT BE "root"]), you will 
need to create any directories you want to put stuff in beforehand as well.
 
It is likely that you will want to run these commands in a crontab type 
situation. You would do that something like:-

  0 0 * * * run_cmd('save /tmp/dxstats "echo DXStat Table", "sh/dxstats"')

Note that you still enclose each command with (") characters but you must
enclose the entire save command in (') characters. 

Now in fact, this can be varied if you know what you are doing. See the
admin manual for more details.
 
=== 0^SEND <call> [<call> ...]^Send a message to one or more callsigns
=== 0^SEND RR <call>^Send a message and ask for a read receipt
=== 0^SEND COPY <msgno> <call>^Send a copy of a  message to someone
=== 0^SEND PRIVATE <call>^Send a personal message
=== 0^SEND NOPRIVATE <call>^Send a message to all stations
All the SEND commands will create a message which will be sent either to
an individual callsign or to one of the 'bulletin' addresses. 

SEND <call> on its own acts as though you had typed SEND PRIVATE, that is
it will mark the message as personal and send it to the cluster node that
that callsign is connected to. If the <call> you have specified is in fact
a known bulletin category on your node (eg: ALL) then the message should
automatically become a bulletin.

You can have more than one callsign in all of the SEND commands.

You can have multiple qualifiers so that you can have for example:-

  SEND RR COPY 123 PRIVATE G1TLH G0RDI

which should send a copy of message 123 to G1TLH and G0RDI and you will
receive a read receipt when they have read the message.

SB is an alias for SEND NOPRIVATE (or send a bulletin in BBS speak)
SP is an alias for SEND PRIVATE

The system will ask you for a subject. Conventionally this should be 
no longer than 29 characters for compatibility. Most modern cluster
software should accept more.

You will now be prompted to start entering your text. 

You finish the message by entering '/EX' on a new line. For instance:

  ...
  bye then Jim
  73 Dirk
  /ex

If you have started a message and you don't want to keep it then you
can abandon the message with '/ABORT' on a new line, like:-

  line 1
  line 2
  oh I just can't be bothered with this
  /abort

If you abort the message it will NOT be sent.

When you are entering the text of your message, most normal output (such
as DX announcements and so on are suppressed and stored for latter display
(upto 20 such lines are stored, as new ones come along, so the oldest
lines are dropped).

Also, you can enter normal commands commands (and get the output 
immediately) whilst in the middle of a message. You do this by typing
the command preceeded by a '/' character on a new line, so:-

  /dx g1tlh 144010 strong signal

Will issue a dx annoucement to the rest of the cluster. 

Also, you can add the output of a command to your message by preceeding 
the command with '//', thus :-

  //sh/vhftable

This will show YOU the output from SH/VHFTABLE and also store it in the
message. 

You can carry on with the message until you are ready to send it. 

=== 6^SEND_CONFIG^Broadcast PC92 C records
This is the PC92 equivalent of INIT. In that it will send out a new
PC92 C record to all interfaces. This can be used to bring other nodes
up to date quicker after a restart.

=== 0^SET/ADDRESS <your address>^Record your postal address

=== 9^SET/AGWENGINE^Enable the AGW Engine
=== 9^UNSET/AGWENGINE^Disable the AGW Engine
These commands assume that /spider/local/AGWConnect.pm has been setup
correctly and you wish to do some testing or otherwise want to alter
the default state of your connection to the AGW Engine.

=== 9^SET/AGWMONITOR^Enable Monitoring on the AGW Engine
=== 9^UNSET/AGWMONITOR^Disable Monitoring on the AGW Engine

=== 0^SET/ANNOUNCE^Allow announce messages to come out on your terminal
=== 0^UNSET/ANNOUNCE^Stop announce messages coming out on your terminal

=== 0^SET/ANNTALK^Allow talk like announce messages on your terminal
=== 0^UNSET/ANNTALK^Stop talk like announce messages on your terminal
The announce system on legacy cluster nodes is used as a talk 
substitute because the network is so poorly connected. If you:

  unset/anntalk

you will suppress several of these announces, you may miss the odd 
useful one as well, but you would probably miss them anyway in the
welter of useless ones.

  set/anntalk 

allows you to see them again. This is the default.

=== 5^SET/ARCLUSTER <call> [<call>..]^Make the callsign an AR-Cluster node

=== 6^SET/BADDX <call>..^Stop callsigns in a dx spot being propagated
=== 6^UNSET/BADDX <call>..^Propagate a dx spot with this callsign again
Setting a word as 'baddx' will prevent spots with that word in the
'spotted' field (as in: DX 14001.1 FR0G)of a DX spot from going any
further. They will not be displayed and they will not be sent onto
other nodes.

The word must be written in full, no wild cards are allowed eg:-

  set/baddx FORSALE VIDEO FR0G

To allow a word again, use the following command ...

  unset/baddx VIDEO

=== 6^SET/BADNODE <call>..^Stop spots from this node being propagated
=== 6^UNSET/BADNODE <call>..^Allow spots from this node again
Setting a callsign as a 'badnode' will prevent spots from that node 
going any further. They will not be displayed and they will not be 
sent onto other nodes.

The call must be a full eg:-

  set/badnode K1TTT 

will stop anything from K1TTT. If you want SSIDs as well then you must
enter them specifically.

  unset/badnode K1TTT

will allow spots from him again.

Use with extreme care. This command may well be superceeded by FILTERing.

=== 6^SET/BADSPOTTER <call>..^Stop spots from this callsign being propagated
=== 6^UNSET/BADSPOTTER <call>..^Allow spots from this callsign again
Setting a callsign as a 'badspotter' will prevent spots from this callsign 
going any further. They will not be displayed and they will not be 
sent onto other nodes.

The call must be written in full, no wild cards are allowed eg:-

  set/badspotter VE2STN 

will stop anything from VE2STN. This command will automatically
stop spots from this user, regardless of whether or which SSID 
he uses. DO NOT USE SSIDs in the callsign, just use the callsign
as above or below.

  unset/badspotter VE2STN

will allow spots from him again.

Use with extreme care. This command may well be superceded by FILTERing.

This command will also stop TALK and ANNOUNCE/FULL from any user marked
as a BADSPOTTER.

=== 6^SET/BADWORD <word>..^Stop things with this word being propagated
=== 6^UNSET/BADWORD <word>..^Propagate things with this word again
Setting a word as a 'badword' will prevent things like spots,
announces or talks with this word in the the text part from going any
further. They will not be displayed and they will not be sent onto
other nodes.

The word must be written in full, no wild cards are allowed eg:-

  set/badword annihilate annihilated annihilation 

will stop anything with these words in the text.

  unset/badword annihilated

will allow text with this word again.

=== 0^SET/BEEP^Add a beep to DX and other messages on your terminal
=== 0^UNSET/BEEP^Stop beeps for DX and other messages on your terminal

=== 5^SET/BBS <call> [<call>..]^Make the callsign a BBS

=== 0^SET/BUDDY <call> [<call>..]^Add this call to my buddy list
=== 0^UNSET/BUDDY <call> [<call>..]^Remove this call from my buddy list
A notification message 
is sent to you automatically if anybody on your buddy list logs in or
out of any node in this cluster.

=== 5^SET/CLX <call> [<call>..]^Make the callsign an CLX node

=== 9^SET/DEBUG <name>^Add a debug level to the debug set
=== 9^UNSET/DEBUG <name>^Remove a debug level from the debug set
You can choose to log several different levels.  The levels are

 chan
 state
 msg
 cron
 connect

You can show what levels you are logging with SHOW/DEBUG

=== 0^SET/DX^Allow DX messages to come out on your terminal
=== 0^UNSET/DX^Stop DX messages coming out on your terminal

=== 0^SET/DXCQ^Show CQ Zones on the end of DX announcements
=== 0^UNSET/DXCQ^Stop CQ Zones on the end of DX announcements
Display both the Spotter's and the Spotted's CQ Zone on the end
of a DX announcement (there is just enough room). Some user programs
cannot cope with this. The Spotter's CQ is on the RHS of the 
time, the Spotted's CQ is on the LHS.

Conflicts with: SET/DXGRID, SET/DXITU, SHOW/USSTATE

Do a STAT/USER to see which flags you have set if you are confused.  

=== 0^SET/DXITU^Show ITU Zones on the end of DX announcements
=== 0^UNSET/DXITU^Stop ITU Zones on the end of DX announcements
Display both the Spotter's and the Spotted's ITU Zone on the end
of a DX announcement (there is just enough room). Some user programs
cannot cope with this. The Spotter's ITU is on the RHS of the 
time, the Spotted's ITU is on the LHS.

Conflicts with: SET/DXGRID, SET/DXCQ, SHOW/USSTATE

Do a STAT/USER to see which flags you have set if you are confused.  

=== 0^SET/DXGRID^Allow QRA Grid Squares on the end of DX announcements
=== 0^UNSET/DXGRID^Stop QRA Grid Squares on the end of DX announcements
A standard feature which is enabled in version 1.43 and above is 
that if the spotter's grid square is known it is output on the end
of a DX announcement (there is just enough room). Some user programs
cannot cope with this. You can use this command to reset (or set)
this feature.

Conflicts with: SET/DXCQ, SET/DXITU

Do a STAT/USER to see which flags you have set if you are confused.  

=== 5^SET/DXNET <call> [<call>..]^Make the callsign an DXNet node

=== 0^SET/ECHO^Make the cluster echo your input
=== 0^UNSET/ECHO^Stop the cluster echoing your input
If you are connected via a telnet session, different implimentations
of telnet handle echo differently depending on whether you are 
connected via port 23 or some other port. You can use this command
to change the setting appropriately. 

The setting is stored in your user profile.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE THIS COMMAND IF YOU ARE CONNECTED VIA AX25.

=== 0^SET/EMAIL <email> ...^Set email address(es) and forward your personals
=== 0^UNSET/EMAIL^Stop personal msgs being forwarded by email
If any personal messages come in for your callsign then you can use
these commands to control whether they are forwarded onto your email
address. To enable the forwarding do something like:-

  SET/EMAIL mike.tubby@somewhere.com

You can have more than one email address (each one separated by a space).
Emails are forwarded to all the email addresses you specify.

You can disable forwarding by:-

  UNSET/EMAIL

=== 0^SET/HERE^Tell the system you are present at your terminal
=== 0^UNSET/HERE^Tell the system you are absent from your terminal

=== 0^SET/HOMENODE <node> ^Set your normal cluster callsign
Tell the cluster system where you normally connect to. Any Messages sent
to you will normally find their way there should you not be connected.
eg:-
  SET/HOMENODE gb7djk

=== 8^SET/HOPS <call> ann|spots|route|wwv|wcy <n>^Set hop count  
=== 8^UNSET/HOPS <call> ann|spots|route|wwv|wcy^Unset hop count  
Set the hop count for a particular type of broadcast for a node.

This command allows you to set up special hop counts for a node 
for currently: announce, spots, wwv and wcy broadcasts.

eg:
  set/hops gb7djk ann 10
  set/hops gb7mbc spots 20

Set SHOW/HOPS for information on what is already set. This command
creates a filter and works in conjunction with the filter system. 

You can unset the hops with command UNSET/HOPS. For example:-

  unset/hops gb7djk ann
  unset/hops gb7mbc spots


=== 9^SET/ISOLATE^Isolate a node from the rest of the network
Connect a node to your system in such a way that you are a full protocol
member of its network and can see all spots on it, but nothing either leaks
out from it nor goes back into from the rest of the nodes connected to you.

You can potentially connect several nodes in this way.
 
=== 9^UNSET/ISOLATE^Stop Isolation of a node from the rest of the network
Remove isolation from a node - SET/ISOLATE

=== 0^SET/LANGUAGE <lang>^Set the language you want to use
You can select the language that you want the cluster to use. Currently
the languages available are en (English), de (German), es (Spanish),
Czech (cz), French (fr), Portuguese (pt), Italian (it) and nl (Dutch).

=== 5^SET/LOCAL_NODE^Add node to the local_node group
=== 5^UNSET/LOCAL_NODE^Remove node from the local_node group
The 'local_node' group is a group of nodes that you want a user
to perceive as effectively one big node. At the moment, this extends 
only to announcing whenever a user is logging in or out of one of
the nodes in the group (if those users have SET/LOGININFO). 

The local node group is as setup on this node. If you want the other
nodes to also include this node and all the other nodes specified, then
you must get those nodes to also run this command (or rcmd them to do
so).

In principle, therefore, each node determines its own local node group
and these can overlap with other nodes' views.

=== 0^SET/LOCATION <lat & long>^Set your latitude and longitude
=== 9^SET/SYS_LOCATION <lat & long>^Set your cluster latitude and longitude
In order to get accurate headings and such like you must tell the system
what your latitude and longitude is. If you have not yet done a SET/QRA
then this command will set your QRA locator for you. For example:-
  SET/LOCATION 52 22 N 0 57 E

=== 0^SET/LOGININFO^Inform when a station logs in/out locally
=== 0^UNSET/LOGININFO^No longer inform when a station logs in/out locally

=== 9^SET/LOCKOUT <call>^Stop a callsign connecting to the cluster
=== 9^UNSET/LOCKOUT <call>^Allow a callsign to connect to the cluster

=== 8^SET/MAXCONNECT <value> [<call> ..]^Set max incoming connections for user/node
Set the maximum no of connections (parents) an incoming user or node is
allowed to have. If this incoming connection takes it over the separate
limits for users and nodes (defaults: 3 and 8 respectively), then the
connection is refused (with a polite message).

The idea behind this to limit the number of copies of messages that
are sent to users (and nodes). Nodes really don't need to have more than
5 or 6 partners and users don't need more than two connections into the
cluster cloud.

This check is only for INCOMING connections, no check is performed for
outgoing connections.

=== 0^SET/NAME <your name>^Set your name
Tell the system what your name is eg:-
  SET/NAME Dirk

=== 5^SET/NODE <call> [<call>..]^Make the callsign an AK1A cluster
Tell the system that the call(s) are to be treated as AK1A cluster and
fed PC Protocol rather normal user commands.

=== 8^SET/OBSCOUNT <count> <call>^Set the 'pump-up' obscelence PING counter 
From 1.35 onwards neighbouring nodes are pinged at regular intervals (see
SET/PINGINTERVAL), usually 300 seconds or 5 minutes. There is a 'pump-up'
counter which is decremented on every outgoing ping and then reset to
the 'obscount' value on every incoming ping. The default value of this
parameter is 2. 

What this means is that a neighbouring node will be pinged twice at 
(default) 300 second intervals and if no reply has been heard just before
what would be the third attempt, that node is disconnected.

If a ping is heard then the obscount is reset to the full value. Using
default values, if a node has not responded to a ping within 15 minutes,
it is disconnected.

You can set this parameter between 1 and 9.

It is STRONGLY recommended that you don't change the default.

=== 0^SET/PAGE <lines per page>^Set the lines per page
Tell the system how many lines you wish on a page when the number of line
of output from a command is more than this. The default is 20. Setting it
explicitly to 0 will disable paging. 
  SET/PAGE 30
  SET/PAGE 0

The setting is stored in your user profile.

=== 9^SET/PINGINTERVAL <time> <nodecall>^Set ping time to neighbouring nodes 
As from release 1.35 all neighbouring nodes are pinged at regular intervals
in order to determine the rolling quality of the link and, in future, to
affect routing decisions. The default interval is 300 secs or 5 minutes.

You can use this command to set a different interval. Please don't. 

But if you do the value you enter is treated as minutes up 30 and seconds
for numbers greater than that.

This is used also to help determine when a link is down at the far end
(as certain cluster software doesn't always notice), see SET/OBSCOUNT
for more information.

If you must change it (and it may be useful for internet connected nodes
on dynamic IP addresses that go away after a set time of usage) the time
can be specified as:-

  5      which if less than 30 is converted to minutes otherwise is 
         taken as the no of seconds between pings. 
  120s   120 seconds
  5m     5 minutes
  1h     1 hour

Please be aware that this causes traffic to occur on the link, setting 
this value too low may annoy your neighbours beyond the point of 
endurance!

You can switch this off by setting it to 0.

=== 9^SET/PRIVILEGE <n> <call> [<call..]^Set privilege level on a call
Set the privilege level on a callsign. The privilege levels that pertain
to commands are as default:-
  0 - normal user
  1 - allow remote nodes normal user RCMDs
  5 - various privileged commands (including shutdown, but not disc-
      connect), the normal level for another node.
  8 - more privileged commands (including disconnect)
  9 - local sysop privilege. DO NOT SET ANY REMOTE USER OR NODE TO THIS
      LEVEL.
If you are a sysop and you come in as a normal user on a remote connection
your privilege will automatically be set to 0.

=== 0^UNSET/PRIVILEGE^Remove any privilege for this session
You can use this command to 'protect' this session from unauthorised
use. If you want to get your normal privilege back you will need to
either logout and login again (if you are on a console) or use the
SYSOP command.

=== 9^SET/PASSWORD <callsign> <string>^Set a users password
The password for a user can only be set by a full sysop. The string
can contain any characters. 

The way this field is used depends on context. If it is being used in
the SYSOP command context then you are offered 5 random numbers and you
have to supply the corresponding letters. This is now mainly for ax25
connections.

If it is being used on incoming telnet connections then, if a password
is set or the:

  set/var $main::passwdreq = 1

command is executed in the startup script, then a password prompt is
given after the normal 'login: ' prompt.  

=== 0^SET/PASSWORD^Set your own password
This command only works for a 'telnet' user (currently). It will
only work if you have a password already set. This initial password
can only be set by the sysop.

When you execute this command it will ask you for your old password,
then ask you to type in your new password twice (to make sure you
get it right). You may or may not see the data echoed on the screen
as you type, depending on the type of telnet client you have.

=== 9^UNSET/PASSWORD <call> ...^Delete (remove) a user's password
This command allows the sysop to completely delete and remove a 
password for a user. 

=== 0^SET/PROMPT <string>^Set your prompt to <string>
=== 0^UNSET/PROMPT^Set your prompt back to default
This command will set your user prompt to the string that you 
say. The point of this command to enable a user to interface to programs
that are looking for a specific prompt (or else you just want a different
prompt).

  SET/PROMPT clx >

There are some substitutions that can be added to the prompt:

  %C - callsign [which will have ( and ) around it if not here]
  %D - date
  %T - time
  %M - cluster 'mycall'

The standard prompt is defined as:

  SET/PROMPT %C de %M %D %T dxspider >

UNSET/PROMPT will undo the SET/PROMPT command and set your prompt back to
normal.

=== 0^SET/QTC^Enable display of new QTC telegrams in spot info

=== 0^UNSET/QTC^Disable display of new QTC telegrams in spot info

=== 0^SET/QTC_AS_COMMENT^Display of new QTC telegrams in spot comment if qtc is set

=== 0^UNSET/QTC_AS_COMMENT^Display of new QTC telegrams in spot info if qtc is set

=== 9^SET/SYS_QRA <locator>^Set your cluster QRA Grid locator
=== 0^SET/QRA <locator>^Set your QRA Grid locator
Tell the system what your QRA (or Maidenhead) locator is. If you have not
done a SET/LOCATION then your latitude and longitude will be set roughly
correctly (assuming your locator is correct ;-). For example:-
  SET/QRA JO02LQ

=== 0^SET/QTH <your qth>^Set your QTH
Tell the system where you are. For example:-
  SET/QTH East Dereham, Norfolk

=== 9^SET/REGISTER <call> ...^Mark a user as registered
=== 9^UNSET/REGISTER <call> ...^Mark a user as not registered
Registration is a concept that you can switch on by executing the

  set/var $main::regreq = 1 

command (usually in your startup file)

If a user is NOT registered then, firstly, instead of the normal
motd file (/spider/data/motd) being sent to the user at startup, the
user is sent the motd_nor file instead. Secondly, the non registered
user only has READ-ONLY access to the node. The non-registered user
cannot use DX, ANN etc. 

The only exception to this is that a non-registered user can TALK or
SEND messages to the sysop.

=== 6^SET/STARTUP <call>^Create a user startup script
=== 0^SET/STARTUP^Create your own startup script
Create a startup script of DXSpider commands which will be executed
everytime that you login into this node. You can only input the whole
script afresh, it is not possible to 'edit' it. Inputting a new script is
just like typing in a message using SEND. To finish inputting type: /EX
on a newline, to abandon the script type: /ABORT.

You may find the (curiously named) command BLANK useful to break 
up the output. If you simply want a blank line, it is easier to 
input one or more spaces and press the <return> key.

See UNSET/STARTUP to remove a script.

=== 6^UNSET/STARTUP <call>^Remove a user startup script
=== 0^UNSET/STARTUP^Remove your own startup script
You can remove your startup script with UNSET/STARTUP.  

=== 5^SET/SPIDER <call> [<call>..]^Make the callsign an DXSpider node
Tell the system that the call(s) are to be treated as DXSpider node and
fed new style DX Protocol rather normal user commands.

=== 0^SET/TALK^Allow TALK messages to come out on your terminal
=== 0^UNSET/TALK^Stop TALK messages coming out on your terminal

=== 9^SET/USDB <call> <state> <city>^add/update a US DB callsign
This command allows you to add or alter a callsign in the US state
database. Use with extreme caution. Anything you do here will be
overwritten by any weekly updates that affect this callsign

  set/usdb g1tlh nh downtown rindge

see also DELETE/USDB

=== 0^SET/USSTATE^Allow US State info on the end of DX announcements
=== 0^UNSET/USSTATE^Stop US State info on the end of DX announcements
If the spotter's or spotted's US State is known it is output on the 
end of a DX announcement (there is just enough room). 

A spotter's state will appear on the RHS of the time (like 
SET/DXGRID) and the spotted's State will appear on the LHS of the
time field. Any information found will override any locator 
information from SET/DXGRID.

Some user programs cannot cope with this. You can use this command 
to reset (or set) this feature.

Conflicts with: SET/DXCQ, SET/DXITU

for more information.

=== 1^SHOW/BADWORD^Show all the bad words in the system
Display all the bad words in the system, see SET/BADWORD
for more information.

=== 0^SHOW/BANDS [band|region names]^Show the list of bands and regions
Display the bands and regions (collections of bands) known to
the system. If you supply band or region names to SHOW/BANDS,
the command will display just those bands or regions, e.g.:

	sh/band
	sh/band 2m hf

=== 0^SHOW/BUDDY^Show your list of buddies
See SET/BUDDY for more information about buddies.

=== 0^SHOW/CHAT [<group>] [<lines>]^Show any chat or conferencing 
This command allows you to see any chat or conferencing that has  
occurred whilst you were away. SHOW/CHAT on its own will show data for
all groups. If you use a group name then it will show only chat for
that group.

=== 9^SHOW/CMD_CACHE [pattern]^Show the real source path of commands
It is possible in DXSpider to define local versions of commands.
Sometimes one forgets that one has these. This command will show you
the source path where the node is getting each one of its commands.

If you find a local command that you don't want then then simply
delete it, run LOAD/CMD_CACHE to clear out the command cache and
try again. You will now be using the standard version.

If you are looking for information on a specific command then
just add a string, eg:

  sh/cmd dx

might give you:

  Command              Path
  set/dxgrid           /spider/cmd/set/dxgrid.pl
  sh/dx                /spider/cmd/show/dx.pl

=== 0^SHOW/CONFIGURATION [<node>]^Show all the nodes and users visible
This command allows you to see all the users that can be seen
and the nodes to which they are connected.

This command is normally abbreviated to: sh/c

Normally, the list returned will be just for the nodes from your 
country (because the list otherwise will be very long).

  SH/C ALL 

will produce a complete list of all nodes. 

BE WARNED: the list that is returned can be VERY long

It is possible to supply a node or part of a prefix and you will get 
a list of the users for that node or list of nodes starting with
that prefix.

  SH/C GB7DJK

  SH/C SK

=== 0^SHOW/CONFIGURATION/NODE^Show all the nodes connected locally
Show all the nodes connected to this node.

=== 1^SHOW/CONNECT^Show all the active connections
This command shows information on all the active connections known to
the node. This command gives slightly more information than WHO.

=== 0^SHOW/CONTEST [<year>] [<month>]^Show all the contests for a month
Show all known contests which are maintained at http://www.sk3bg.se/contest/
for a particular month or year. The format is reasonably flexible.
For example:-
  
  SH/CONTEST 
  SH/CONTEST mar
  SH/CONTEST mar 13
  SH/CONTEST 13 march

If there is no month/year then the current month's contests are shown.

Note that it expects ENGLISH (jan/feb/mar/apr/may/jun/jul/aug/sep/oct/nov/dec)
month names.

=== 0^SHOW/DATE [<prefix>|<callsign>]^Show the local time 
This is very nearly the same as SHOW/TIME, the only difference the format
of the date string if no arguments are given.

If no prefixes or callsigns are given then this command returns the local
time and UTC as the computer has it right now. If you give some prefixes
then it will show UTC and UTC + the local offset (not including DST) at
the prefixes or callsigns that you specify.

=== 0^SHOW/DB0SDX <callsign>^Show QSL infomation from DB0SDX database
This command queries the DB0SDX QSL server on the internet
and returns any information available for that callsign. This service
is provided for users of this software by http://www.qslinfo.de.

See also SHOW/QRZ, SHOW/WM7D.

=== 9^SHOW/DEBUG^Show what levels of debug information you are logging

=== 0^SHOW/DX^Interrogate the spot database
If you just type SHOW/DX you will get the last so many spots
(sysop configurable, but usually 10).
   
In addition you can add any number of these commands in very nearly
any order to the basic SHOW/DX command, they are:-
   
 on <band>       - eg 160m 20m 2m 23cm 6mm
 on <region>     - eg hf vhf uhf shf      (see SHOW/BANDS)
 on <from>/<to>  - eg 1000/4000 14000-30000  (in Khz)
    <from>-<to>
   
 <number>        - the number of spots you want
 <from>-<to>     - <from> spot no <to> spot no in the selected list
 <from>/<to>
   
 <prefix>        - for a spotted callsign beginning with <prefix>
 *<suffix>       - for a spotted callsign ending in <suffix>
 *<string>*      - for a spotted callsign containing <string>
 <call> exact    - for a spotted callsign *exactly* as typed.
   
 day <number>    - starting <number> days ago
 day <from>-<to> - <from> days <to> days ago
     <from>/<to>   

 info <text>     - any spots containing <text> in the info or remarks
    
 by <call>       - any spots spotted by <call> (spotter <call> is the 
                   same).

 qsl             - this automatically looks for any qsl info on the call
                   held in the spot database.

 iota [<iota>]   - If the iota island number is missing it will look for
                  the string iota and anything which looks like an iota
                  island number. If you specify then it will look for  
                  that island.

 qra [<locator>] - this will look for the specific locator if you specify
                   one or else anything that looks like a locator.

 dxcc            - treat the prefix as a 'country' and look for spots
                   from that country regardless of actual prefix.
                   eg dxcc oq2 
                  
                   You can also use this with the 'by' keyword so 
                   eg by W dxcc  
 
 real or rt      - Format the output the same as for real time spots. The
                   formats are deliberately different (so you can tell
                   one sort from the other). This is useful for some 
                   logging programs that can't cope with normal sh/dx 
                   output. An alias of SHOW/FDX is available.
       
 filter          - Filter the spots, before output, with the user's 
                   spot filter. An alias of SHOW/MYDX is available.

 zone <zones>    - look for spots in the cq zone (or zones) specified.
                   zones are numbers separated by commas.

 by_zone <zones> - look for spots spotted by people in the cq zone
                   specified.

 itu <itus>      - look for spots in the itu zone (or zones) specified
                   itu zones are numbers separated by commas.

 by_itu <itus>   - look for spots spotted by people in the itu zone
                   specified.
  
 state <list>    - look for spots in the US state (or states) specified
                   The list is two letter state codes separated by commas.

 by_state <list> - look for spots spotted by people in the US state
                   specified.
 
 e.g. 
   
   SH/DX 9m0
   SH/DX on 20m info iota
   SH/DX 9a on vhf day 30
   SH/DX rf1p qsl
   SH/DX iota 
   SH/DX iota eu-064
   SH/DX qra jn86

=== 0^SHOW/DXCC <prefix>^Interrogate the spot database by country
This command takes the <prefix> (which can be a full or partial 
callsign if desired), looks up which internal country number it is
and then displays all the spots as per SH/DX for that country.

This is now an alias for 'SHOW/DX DXCC' 
   
The options for SHOW/DX also apply to this command.   
e.g. 
   
   SH/DXCC G
   SH/DXCC W on 20m iota

This can be done with the SHOW/DX command like this:-

   SH/DX dxcc g
   SH/DX dxcc w on 20m iota

This is an alias for: SH/DX dxcc

=== 0^SHOW/FDX^Show the DX data in realtime format.
Normally SHOW/DX outputs spot data in a different format to the
realtime data. This is a deliberate policy (so you can tell the 
difference between the two). Some logging programs cannot handle
this so SHOW/FDX outputs historical data in real time format.

This is an alias for: SHOW/DX real

=== 0^SHOW/DXSTATS [days] [date]^Show the DX Statistics
Show the total DX spots for the last <days> no of days (default is 31), 
starting from a <date> (default: today).

=== 0^SHOW/FILES [<filearea> [<string>]]^List the contents of a filearea
SHOW/FILES on its own will show you a list of the various fileareas
available on the system. To see the contents of a particular file
area type:-
   SH/FILES <filearea>
where <filearea> is the name of the filearea you want to see the 
contents of.

You can also use shell globbing characters like '*' and '?' in a
string to see a selection of files in a filearea eg:-
   SH/FILES bulletins arld*

See also TYPE - to see the contents of a file.

=== 0^SHOW/FILTER^Show the contents of all the filters you have set
Show the contents of all the filters that are set. This command displays
all the filters set - for all the various categories.

=== 0^SHOW/GRAYLINE [ndays] [<prefix>|<callsign>]^Show Civil dawn/dusk times
This command is very similar to SHOW/SUN except that it shows the 
start and end of "Official" or "Civil" Dawn and Dusk. This is defined 
as when the Sun is 6 degrees below the horizon.

If you don't specify any prefixes or callsigns, it will show the 
times for your QTH (assuming you have set it with either SET/LOCATION 
or SET/QRA), together with the current azimuth and elevation.

If all else fails it will show the civil dawn and dusk times for 
the node that you are connected to.

For example:-

  SH/GRAYLINE
  SH/GRAYLINE G1TLH W5UN

You can also use this command to see into the past or the future, so
if you want to see yesterday's times then do:-

  SH/GRAYLINE -1

or in three days time:-

  SH/GRAYLINE +3 W9

Upto 366 days can be checked both in the past and in the future.

Please note that the times are given as the UT times of the requested
UT day.
	
=== 0^SHOW/HFSTATS [days] [date]^Show the HF DX Statistics 
Show the HF DX spots breakdown by band for the last <days> no of days 
(default is 31), starting from a <date> (default: today).

=== 0^SHOW/HFTABLE [days] [date] [prefix ...]^Show the HF DX Spotter Table
Show the HF DX Spotter table for the list of prefixes for the last 
<days> no of days (default is 31), starting from a <date> (default: today).

If there are no prefixes then it will show the table for your country.

Remember that some countries have more than one "DXCC country" in them
(eg G :-), to show them (assuming you are not in G already which is
specially treated in the code) you must list all the relevant prefixes

  sh/hftable g gm gd gi gj gw gu 

Note that the prefixes are converted into country codes so you don't have
to list all possible prefixes for each country.

If you want more or less days than the default simply include the
number you require:-

  sh/hftable 20 pa

If you want to start at a different day, simply add the date in some 
recognizable form:-

  sh/hftable 2 25nov02
  sh/hftable 2 25-nov-02 
  sh/hftable 2 021125 
  sh/hftable 2 25/11/02

This will show the stats for your DXCC for that CQWW contest weekend. 

You can specify either prefixes or full callsigns (so you can see how you
did against all your mates). You can also say 'all' which will then print
the worldwide statistics.

  sh/hftable all 

=== 8^SHOW/HOPS <call> [ann|spots|route|wcy|wwv]^Show the hop counts for a node
This command shows the hop counts set up for a node. You can specify
which category you want to see. If you leave the category out then 
all the categories will be listed.

=== 0^SHOW/IK3QAR <callsign>^Obtain QSL info from IK3QAR database
Get QSL information from the online dabase run by IK3QAR.

Your sysop needs to set up this command by obtaining a password from IK3QAR.
Instructions are available in local/Internet.pm

=== 1^SHOW/ISOLATE^Show list of ISOLATED nodes

=== 9^SHOW/LOCKOUT <prefix>|ALL^Show the list of locked out or excluded callsigns

=== 8^SHOW/LOG [<callsign>]^Show excerpts from the system log
This command outputs a short section of the system log.  On its own
it will output a general logfile.  With the optional callsign it will
show output from the log associated with that callsign.

=== 0^SHOW/MOON [ndays] [<prefix>|<callsign>]^Show Moon rise and set times
Show the Moon rise and set times for a (list of) prefixes or callsigns, 
together with the azimuth and elevation of the sun currently at those
locations.

If you don't specify any prefixes or callsigns, it will show the times for
your QTH (assuming you have set it with either SET/LOCATION or SET/QRA),
together with the current azimuth and elevation.

In addition, it will show the illuminated fraction of the moons disk.

If all else fails it will show the Moonrise and set times for the node
that you are connected to. 

For example:-

  SH/MOON
  SH/MOON G1TLH W5UN

You can also use this command to see into the past or the future, so
if you want to see yesterday's times then do:-

  SH/MOON -1 

or in three days time:-

  SH/MOON +3 W9

Upto 366 days can be checked both in the past and in the future.

Please note that the rise and set times are given as the UT times of rise and 
set on the requested UT day.

=== 0^SHOW/MOTD^Show your MOTD (the Message of the Day)
The Message of the Day is normally printed whenever one logs on. However
many people now login using logging programs or something other than plain
telnet or ax25 connections. This command allows the user (or the program)
to see what is in the MOTD.

The actual MOTD that you are shown depends on what carrier you are logged
on via, whether you are registered and some other factors that your sysop
may have thrown in.

=== 0^SHOW/MUF <prefix> [<hours>][long]^Show the likely propagation to a prefix
This command allow you to estimate the likelihood of you contacting
a station with the prefix you have specified. The output assumes a modest
power of 20dBW and receiver sensitivity of -123dBm (about 0.15muV/10dB SINAD)

The result predicts the most likely operating frequencies and signal
levels for high frequency (shortwave) radio propagation paths on
specified days of the year and hours of the day. It is most useful for
paths between 250 km and 6000 km, but can be used with reduced accuracy
for paths shorter or longer than this.

The command uses a routine MINIMUF 3.5 developed by the U.S. Navy and
used to predict the MUF given the predicted flux, day of the year,
hour of the day and geographic coordinates of the transmitter and
receiver. This routine is reasonably accurate for the purposes here,
with a claimed RMS error of 3.8 MHz, but much smaller and less complex
than the programs used by major shortwave broadcasting organizations,
such as the Voice of America.

The command will display some header information detailing its
assumptions, together with the locations, latitude and longitudes and
bearings. It will then show UTC (UT), local time at the other end
(LT), calculate the MUFs, Sun zenith angle at the midpoint of the path
(Zen) and the likely signal strengths. Then for each frequency for which
the system thinks there is a likelihood of a circuit it prints a value.

The value is currently a likely S meter reading based on the conventional
6dB / S point scale. If the value has a '+' appended it means that it is
1/2 an S point stronger. If the value is preceeded by an 'm' it means that
there is likely to be much fading and by an 's' that the signal is likely
to be noisy.  

By default SHOW/MUF will show the next two hours worth of data. You
can specify anything up to 24 hours worth of data by appending the no of
hours required after the prefix. For example:-

  SH/MUF W

produces:

  RxSens: -123 dBM SFI: 159   R: 193   Month: 10   Day: 21
  Power :   20 dBW    Distance:  6283 km    Delay: 22.4 ms
  Location                       Lat / Long           Azim
  East Dereham, Norfolk          52 41 N 0 57 E         47
  United-States-W                43 0 N 87 54 W        299
  UT LT  MUF Zen  1.8  3.5  7.0 10.1 14.0 18.1 21.0 24.9 28.0 50.0
  18 23 11.5 -35  mS0+ mS2   S3
  19  0 11.2 -41  mS0+ mS2   S3

indicating that you will have weak, fading circuits on top band and 
80m but usable signals on 40m (about S3).

inputing:-

  SH/MUF W 24

will get you the above display, but with the next 24 hours worth of
propagation data.

  SH/MUF W L 24
  SH/MUF W 24 Long

Gives you an estimate of the long path propagation characterics. It
should be noted that the figures will probably not be very useful, nor
terrible accurate, but it is included for completeness.

=== 0^SHOW/MYDX^Show the DX data filtered with your spot filter.
SHOW/DX potentially shows all the spots available in the system. Using
SHOW/MYDX will, instead, filter the availble spots using any spot filter 
that you have set, first. 

This command, together with ACCEPT/SPOT or REJECT/SPOT, will allow
you to customise the spots that you receive.

So if you have said: ACC/SPOT on hf

Doing a SHOW/MYDX will now only, ever, show HF spots. All the other 
options on SH/DX can still be used.

=== 0^SHOW/NEWCONFIGURATION [USERS|<node call>]^Show the cluster map
Show the map of the whole cluster.

This shows the structure of the cluster that you are connected to. By
default it will only show the nodes that are known. By adding the keyword
USER to the command it will show all the users as well.

As there will be loops, you will see '...', this means that the information
is as printed earlier and that is a looped connection from here on.

BE WARNED: the list that is returned can be VERY long (particularly
with the USER keyword)

=== 0^SHOW/NEWCONFIGURATION/NODE^Show all the nodes connected locally
Show all the nodes connected to this node in the new format.

=== 1^SHOW/NODE [<callsign> ...]^Show the type and version number of nodes
Show the type and version (if connected) of the nodes specified on the
command line. If no callsigns are specified then a sorted list of all
the non-user callsigns known to the system will be displayed.

=== 0^SHOW/PREFIX <callsign>^Interrogate the prefix database 
This command takes the <callsign> (which can be a full or partial 
callsign or a prefix), looks up which internal country number 
it is and then displays all the relevant prefixes for that country
together with the internal country no, the CQ and ITU regions. 

See also SHOW/DXCC

=== 5^SHOW/PROGRAM^Show the locations of all the included program modules
Show the name and location where every program module was load from. This
is useful for checking where you think you have loaded a .pm file from. 

=== 0^SHOW/QRA <locator> [<locator>]^Show distance between QRA Grid locators
=== 0^SHOW/QRA <lat> <long>^Convert lat/long to a QRA Grid locator
This is a multipurpose command that allows you either to calculate the
distance and bearing between two locators or (if only one locator is
given on the command line) the distance and beraing from your station
to the locator. For example:-

 SH/QRA IO92QL 
 SH/QRA JN06 IN73

The first example will show the distance and bearing to the locator from
yourself, the second example will calculate the distance and bearing from
the first locator to the second. You can use 4 or 6 character locators.

It is also possible to convert a latitude and longitude to a locator by 
using this command with a latitude and longitude as an argument, for
example:-

 SH/QRA 52 41 N 0 58 E

=== 0^SHOW/QRZ <callsign>^Show any callbook details on a callsign
This command queries the QRZ callbook server on the internet
and returns any information available for that callsign. This service
is provided for users of this software by http://www.qrz.com 

See also SHOW/WM7D for an alternative.

=== 0^SHOW/DXQSL <callsign>^Show any QSL info gathered from spots
The node collects information from the comment fields in spots (things
like 'VIA EA7WA' or 'QSL-G1TLH') and stores these in a database.

This command allows you to interrogate that database and if the callsign
is found will display the manager(s) that people have spotted. This 
information is NOT reliable, but it is normally reasonably accurate if
it is spotted enough times.

For example:-

  sh/dxqsl 4k9w

You can check the raw input spots yourself with:-

  sh/dx 4k9w qsl

This gives you more background information.

=== 9^SHOW/REGISTERED [<prefix>]^Show the registered users

=== 0^SHOW/ROUTE <callsign> ...^Show the route to the callsign
This command allows you to see to which node the callsigns specified are
connected. It is a sort of inverse sh/config.

 sh/route n2tly

=== 9^SHOW/RCMD [<n>][<from>-<to>][<call>] ...^Show log of rcmds
Show the rcmds that have come in and their replies.

=== 0^SHOW/SATELLITE <name> [<hours> <interval>]^Show tracking data
Show the tracking data from your location to the satellite of your choice
from now on for the next few hours.

If you use this command without a satellite name it will display a list
of all the satellites known currently to the system. 

If you give a name then you can obtain tracking data of all the passes
that start and finish 5 degrees below the horizon. As default it will
give information for the next three hours for every five minute period.

You can alter the number of hours and the step size, within certain 
limits. 

Each pass in a period is separated with a row of '-----' characters

So for example:-

 SH/SAT AO-10 
 SH/SAT FENGYUN1 12 2

=== 6^SHOW/STARTUP <call>^View a user startup script
=== 0^SHOW/STARTUP^View your own startup script
View the contents of a startup script created with SET/STARTUP.

=== 6^SHOW/STATION ALL [<regex>]^Show list of users in the system
=== 0^SHOW/STATION [<callsign> ..]^Show information about a callsign
Show the information known about a callsign and whether (and where)
that callsign is connected to the cluster.

  SH/ST G1TLH

If no callsign is given then show the information for yourself.

=== 0^SHOW/SUN [ndays] [<prefix>|<callsign>]^Show sun rise and set times
Show the sun rise and set times for a (list of) prefixes or callsigns, 
together with the azimuth and elevation of the sun currently at those
locations.

If you don't specify any prefixes or callsigns, it will show the times for
your QTH (assuming you have set it with either SET/LOCATION or SET/QRA),
together with the current azimuth and elevation.

If all else fails it will show the sunrise and set times for the node
that you are connected to. 

For example:-

  SH/SUN
  SH/SUN G1TLH K9CW ZS

You can also use this command to see into the past or the future, so
if you want to see yesterday's times then do:-

  SH/SUN -1 

or in three days time:-

  SH/SUN +3 W9

Upto 366 days can be checked both in the past and in the future.

Please note that the rise and set times are given as the UT times of rise 
and set on the requested UT day.

=== 0^SHOW/TELEGRAM [<callsign>] [<type>] [<amount>] [<page>]^Schows QTC Net telegrams

This command shows QTC-Net Telegrams if a callsign is mentioned it shows 
the telegrams of that callsign. Type can be new, timeline_new, timeline, 
all or sent the command then shows the telegrams of that type.

amount and page are controlling how many telegrams should be listed and 
which block of <amount> telegrams is to be displayed. 

You may use the qsp command later to mark telegrams as read, so they do not 
show up as new or timeline_new telegrams anymore. 

=== 0^SHOW/TIME [<prefix>|<callsign>]^Show the local time 
If no prefixes or callsigns are given then this command returns the local
time and UTC as the computer has it right now. If you give some prefixes
then it will show UTC and UTC + the local offset (not including DST) at
the prefixes or callsigns that you specify.

=== 0^SHOW/USDB [call ..]^Show information held on the FCC Call database
Show the City and State of a Callsign held on the FCC database if
his is being run on this system, eg:-

  sh/usdb k1xx

=== 0^SHOW/VHFSTATS [days] [date]^Show the VHF DX Statistics
Show the VHF DX spots breakdown by band for the last 
<days> no of days (default is 31), starting from a date (default: today).

=== 0^SHOW/VHFTABLE [days] [date] [prefix ...]^Show the VHF DX Spotter Table
Show the VHF DX Spotter table for the list of prefixes for the last 
<days> no of days (default is 31), starting from a date (default: today).

If there are no prefixes then it will show the table for your country.

Remember that some countries have more than one "DXCC country" in them
(eg G :-), to show them (assuming you are not in G already which is
specially treated in the code) you must list all the relevant prefixes

  sh/vhftable g gm gd gi gj gw gu 

Note that the prefixes are converted into country codes so you don't have
to list all possible prefixes for each country.

If you want more or less days than the default simply include the
number you require:-

  sh/vhftable 20 pa

If you want to start at a different day, simply add the date in some 
recognizable form:-

  sh/vhftable 2 25nov02
  sh/vhftable 2 25-nov-02 
  sh/vhftable 2 021125 
  sh/vhftable 2 25/11/02

This will show the stats for your DXCC for that CQWW contest weekend. 

You can specify either prefixes or full callsigns (so you can see how you
did against all your mates). You can also say 'all' which will then print
the worldwide statistics.

  sh/vhftable all 

=== 0^SHOW/WCY^Show last 10 WCY broadcasts
=== 0^SHOW/WCY <n>^Show last <n> WCY broadcasts
Display the most recent WCY information that has been received by the system
 
=== 0^SHOW/WM7D <callsign>^Show callbook details on a US callsigns
This command queries the WM7D callbook server on the internet
and returns any information available for that US callsign. This service
is provided for users of this software by http://www.wm7d.net.

See also SHOW/QRZ. 

=== 0^SHOW/WWV^Show last 10 WWV broadcasts
=== 0^SHOW/WWV <n>^Show last <n> WWV broadcasts
Display the most recent WWV information that has been received by the system

=== 5^SHUTDOWN^Shutdown the cluster
Shutdown the cluster and disconnect all the users 

=== 9^SPOOF <call> <command>^Do a command as though you are another user
This command is provided so that sysops can set a user's parameters without
me having to write a special 'sysop' version for every user command. It
allows you to pretend that you are doing the command as the user you specify.

eg:-

   SPOOF G1TLH set/name Dirk
   SPOOF G1TLH set/qra JO02LQ

=== 5^STAT/DB <dbname>^Show the status of a database
Show the internal status of a database descriptor.

Depending on your privilege level you will see more or less information. 
This command is unlikely to be of much use to anyone other than a sysop.

=== 5^STAT/CHANNEL [<callsign>]^Show the status of a channel on the cluster
Show the internal status of the channel object either for the channel that 
you are on or else for the callsign that you asked for.

Only the fields that are defined (in perl term) will be displayed.

=== 1^STAT/MSG^Show the status of the message system
=== 1^STAT/MSG <msgno>^Show the status of a message
This command shows the internal status of a message and includes information
such as to whom it has been forwarded, its size, origin etc etc.

If no message number is given then the status of the message system is 
displayed.

=== 5^STAT/ROUTE_NODE <callsign>^Show the data in a Route::Node object
=== 5^STAT/ROUTE_NODE all^Show list of all Route::Node objects

=== 5^STAT/ROUTE_USER <callsign>^Show the data in a Route::User object
=== 5^STAT/ROUTE_USER all^Show list of all Route::User objects

=== 5^STAT/USER [<callsign>]^Show the full status of a user
Shows the full contents of a user record including all the secret flags
and stuff.

Only the fields that are defined (in perl term) will be displayed.

=== 0^SYSOP^Regain your privileges if you login remotely
The system automatically reduces your privilege level to that of a
normal user if you login in remotely. This command allows you to
regain your normal privilege level. It uses the normal system: five
numbers are returned that are indexes into the character array that is
your assigned password (see SET/PASSWORD). The indexes start from
zero.

You are expected to return a string which contains the characters
required in the correct order. You may intersperse those characters
with others to obscure your reply for any watchers. For example (and
these values are for explanation :-):

  password = 012345678901234567890123456789
  > sysop
  22 10 15 17 3
you type:-
 aa2bbbb0ccc5ddd7xxx3n
 or 2 0 5 7 3
 or 20573

They will all match. If there is no password you will still be offered
numbers but nothing will happen when you input a string. Any match is
case sensitive.

=== 0^TALK <call> [<text>]^Send a text message to another station
=== 0^TALK <call> > <node> [<text>]^Send a text message to another station via a node
Send a short message to any other station that is visible on the cluster
system. You can send it to anyone you can see with a SHOW/CONFIGURATION 
command, they don't have to be connected locally.

The second form of TALK is used when other cluster nodes are connected
with restricted information. This usually means that they don't send 
the user information usually associated with logging on and off the cluster.

If you know that G3JNB is likely to be present on GB7TLH, but you can only
see GB7TLH in the SH/C list but with no users, then you would use the
second form of the talk message.

If you want to have a ragchew with someone you can leave the text message
out and the system will go into 'Talk' mode. What this means is that a
short message is sent to the recipient telling them that you are in a
'Talking' frame of mind and then you just type - everything you send will
go to the station that you asked for. 

All the usual announcements, spots and so on will still come out on your
terminal.

If you want to do something (such as send a spot) you preceed the normal 
command with a '/' character, eg:-

   /DX 14001 G1TLH What's a B class licensee doing on 20m CW?
   /HELP talk

To leave talk mode type:
   
   /EX

If you are in 'Talk' mode, there is an extention to the '/' command which
allows you to send the output to all the people you are talking to. You do 
with the '//' command. For example:-

  //sh/hftable

will send the hftable as you have it to all the people you are currently 
talking to.

=== 0^TELEGRAM [<fromcall>] [<tocall>] [<text>]^send a qtc-net telegram

This command sends a qtc net telegram. fromcall tocall text....
